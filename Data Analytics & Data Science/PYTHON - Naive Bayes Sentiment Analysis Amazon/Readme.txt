This project delves into sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. It involved preprocessing the review data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), implementing a machine learning model using Naive Bayes, and evaluating the model's performance with a validation set.

Key components of the project included:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the review data by removing noise, handling missing values, and applying text normalization techniques to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights, which helped in understanding the underlying sentiments in the reviews.
Machine Learning with Naive Bayes: Employing the Naive Bayes algorithm to develop a sentiment analysis model. This process involved training the model with a subset of the data, testing its predictions, and fine-tuning its parameters to enhance accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Utilizing a separate validation set to rigorously assess the model's effectiveness in classifying sentiments, ensuring the reliability of the analysis.
The goal of this sentiment analysis was to accurately categorize Amazon product reviews into positive or negative sentiments, providing valuable feedback on customer satisfaction and product reception. The project showcases the application of Naive Bayes in sentiment analysis, demonstrating the ability to derive meaningful conclusions from unstructured text data.

The results, presented in a Jupyter notebook, offer insights into the sentiment distribution among the reviews and the model's performance metrics. This analysis not only highlights the practical use of machine learning in understanding customer perspectives but also enhances decision-making processes based on customer feedback analysis.
