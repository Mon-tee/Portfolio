This project serves as a showcase of my advanced SQL capabilities, with a focus on complex techniques including the use of join clauses, Common Table Expressions (CTE), creation of views, and sophisticated table structuring. It revolves around the meticulous analysis and management of Covid-19 death data spanning from 2020 to 2022. This endeavor not only highlights my proficiency in handling intricate data scenarios but also underscores my strategic approach in data organization.

To further demonstrate these advanced techniques, I strategically divided my original CSV file into two separate files. This deliberate segmentation was implemented to provide a clearer platform for showcasing my skills in managing and manipulating data using more sophisticated SQL methods.

Additionally, due to file size limits on GitHub (the file is larger than 25MB), I am unable to upload the original CSV file there. This limitation underscores the large-scale nature of the data involved in this project and the necessity for efficient data management and processing techniques.
