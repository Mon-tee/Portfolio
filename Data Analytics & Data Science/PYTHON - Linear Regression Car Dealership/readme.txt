This project showcases a comprehensive linear regression analysis focusing on car sales data for a car dealership, employing the sklearn library. The objective was to clean and preprocess the data, relax certain model assumptions, perform log transformations, develop a predictive model, and utilize dummy variables to handle categorical data effectively.

Key steps in the analysis included:

Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies within the dataset to ensure a robust analysis.
Assumption Checks: Evaluating and adjusting for the assumptions underlying linear regression to enhance model reliability.
Log Transformation: Applying log transformations to certain variables to improve model fit and handle skewness in the data.
Model Creation: Using sklearn to build a linear regression model that predicts car sales based on various features.
Dummy Variables: Generating dummy variables for categorical data to include them effectively in the regression model.
The dataset for this analysis pertained to various aspects of car sales, including but not limited to, car features, pricing, and sales figures. The comprehensive approach aimed to provide a holistic view of the factors influencing car sales at the dealership.

The results, encapsulated within a Jupyter notebook, illustrate the model's performance and the insights derived regarding the predictors of car sales. This project not only highlights the application of linear regression in a commercial context but also demonstrates a range of data handling and analysis skills.

To engage with this analysis, one can clone the repository and execute the Jupyter notebook, ensuring all necessary libraries are installed. This project is a testament to the ability to apply statistical modeling and data science techniques to real-world business data, offering valuable insights into the automotive sales industry.
