KMeans Clustering of Income Dataset
This repository contains code for performing KMeans clustering on a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset, sourced from Siddharthaborgohain on Kaggle, provides information on age and income.

Methodology
The main objective of this project is to cluster individuals based on their age and income using the KMeans algorithm. To determine the optimal number of clusters, the elbow method is employed. This technique helps in identifying the appropriate number of clusters by analyzing the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) across a range of cluster numbers.

Contents
data/: Contains the dataset used for clustering.
kmeans_clustering.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code for KMeans clustering using the elbow method.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
Open and run the kmeans_clustering.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to load the dataset, perform KMeans clustering, and visualize the results.
Note
This project serves as a demonstration of applying KMeans clustering on a specific dataset. Feel free to explore and modify the code for your own datasets or analyses.
