Netflix Userbase Analysis Project

This project utilizes the synthetic Netflix Userbase Dataset from Kaggle, which includes diverse data like subscription types, revenue, join/payment dates, user country, device type, and account status. 
This dataset is ideal for deep analysis and understanding user trends and preferences.

The primary focus of this project is to showcase my SQL skills. 
Unlike typical scenarios where SQL is used for preliminary data handling before employing R or Python for further analysis, this project centers on demonstrating my SQL expertise through comprehensive data manipulation and querying.

A live dashboard based on this data can be found here:
