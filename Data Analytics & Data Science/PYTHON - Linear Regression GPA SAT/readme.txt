Simple Linear Regression: GPA vs. SAT Scores

This repository contains a simple linear regression analysis that examines the relationship between GPA and SAT scores using a dataset from Kaggle provided by luddarell.

Overview:

The project explores the commonly held belief in academic and professional circles that GPA and SAT scores are interconnected. It uses simple linear regression to analyze the relationship between these two variables.

Libraries Used:

numpy: Included for potential future data manipulation, not directly used here.
pandas: For data handling and manipulation.
matplotlib.pyplot: For creating visual representations of the data and analysis results.
statsmodels.api: For performing the linear regression analysis.
seaborn: To enhance the aesthetics of the plots.

Dataset:

The dataset from Kaggle includes two main variables: GPA (Grade Point Average of students) and SAT (SAT scores of students).

Analysis:

The primary goal is to use simple linear regression to understand how GPA can be predicted based on SAT scores, helping to identify the relationship's strength and nature between these two variables.

Results:

The analysis results, including regression model summaries and plots, are in the Jupyter notebook in this repository. They offer insights into the correlation between GPA and SAT scores and predictive relationships.

Usage:

To replicate this analysis or explore the dataset further, clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook. Make sure all required libraries are installed. Install necessary libraries with:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib statsmodels seaborn

Contributions to enhance the analysis or extend the project's scope are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
