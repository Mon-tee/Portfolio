Simple Linear Regression: GPA vs. SAT Scores
This repository contains a simple linear regression analysis exploring the relationship between GPA and SAT scores. The data used in this project is sourced from a Kaggle dataset provided by luddarell.

Overview
In many academic and professional settings, there is a belief that GPA and SAT scores are interconnected. This project aims to delve into this hypothesis by applying simple linear regression analysis to understand the relationship between these two variables.

Libraries Used
numpy: Although not directly used in the analysis, numpy is included for potential future data manipulation needs.
pandas: Utilized for data handling and manipulation.
matplotlib.pyplot: Used for creating visual representations of our data and analysis results.
statsmodels.api: Employed for performing the linear regression analysis.
seaborn: Enhances the aesthetics of the plots, making the data visualization more appealing.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle and can be accessed here. It contains two main variables:

GPA: The Grade Point Average of students.
SAT: The SAT scores of students.
Analysis
The main focus of the analysis is to apply simple linear regression to understand how GPA can be predicted based on SAT scores. The regression model will help in identifying the strength and nature of the relationship between these two variables.

Results
The analysis results, including the regression model summary and relevant plots, are presented in the Jupyter notebook within this repository. These results provide insights into the correlation between GPA and SAT scores and how one can be used to predict the other.

Usage
To replicate this analysis or delve deeper into the dataset, clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook. Ensure that you have all the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib statsmodels seaborn
