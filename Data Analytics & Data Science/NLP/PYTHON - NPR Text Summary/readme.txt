Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this tool extracts key information from lengthy articles, making it easier to consume important news quickly.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopwords removal, and text normalization.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text into a numeric form suitable for machine learning models.
Cosine Similarity: Measures the similarity between different text segments to identify the most relevant information for summaries.
