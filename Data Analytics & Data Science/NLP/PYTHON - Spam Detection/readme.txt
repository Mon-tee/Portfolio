# Portfolio Project: Spam Detection System

## Overview
This project develops a spam detection system using machine learning. It aims to accurately classify text messages as spam or not spam based on their content. This model could be applied to enhance email filtering systems and improve user experience by reducing unwanted messages.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes `pandas` for data manipulation and `CountVectorizer` for converting text data into a machine-readable format.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Employs a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, known for its efficacy in text classification tasks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes accuracy, F1 score, and ROC AUC score to assess the model performance.
- **Visualization**: Uses `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizing model performance through confusion matrices and ROC curves. Also includes word cloud visualizations for spam and non-spam messages.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- WordCloud

## Setup and Usage
1. Ensure Python and pip are installed.
2. Install the required packages: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn wordcloud`
3. Run the notebook `Spam_Detection.ipynb` to train the model and visualize the results.
