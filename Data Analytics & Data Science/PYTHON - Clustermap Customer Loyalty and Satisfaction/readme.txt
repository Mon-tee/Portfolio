Customer Loyalty and Satisfaction Cluster Analysis
This repository contains code for performing cluster analysis on customer data obtained from Kaggle. The dataset utilized for this analysis aims to understand customer loyalty and satisfaction.

Methodology
The main objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior and preferences using cluster analysis techniques. By leveraging the information gleaned from the Kaggle dataset, we aim to identify patterns related to customer loyalty and satisfaction. The analysis primarily focuses on creating a simple cluster map to visualize clusters of customers based on their attributes.
